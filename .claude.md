# Real Estate Calculator - Project Context

## Project Overview
This is a React-based real estate investment calculator that helps users analyze property deals by calculating mortgage payments, cash flow, ROI, cap rate, and other investment metrics.

## User Profile
I'm a PM with limited coding experience. When you're coding or doing your work, please share tips that explain the tech architecture and any changes that you're making and why.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Charts**: Chart.js or Recharts (Milestone 3)
- **Storage**: LocalStorage
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub

## Key Files
- `spec.md` - Complete project specification with all requirements, formulas, and milestones
- `todo.md` - Detailed task list organized by milestone
- `src/App.jsx` - Main application component (to be created)
- `src/components/InputForm.jsx` - Property input form (to be created)
- `src/components/ResultsDashboard.jsx` - Results display (to be created)
- `src/utils/calculations.js` - Financial calculation functions (to be created in Milestone 2)

## Development Workflow
1. **Always use plan mode before coding** (Shift+Tab to enter plan mode)
2. **Follow Spec → Todo → Code process** for each milestone
3. **Build incrementally**:
   - Milestone 1: UI with dummy data
   - Milestone 2: Real calculations
   - Milestone 3: Enhanced features
4. **Test frequently** on localhost after each change
5. **Commit to GitHub** after each milestone

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Planning Complete
- **Current Milestone**: Ready to start Milestone 1
- **Next Steps**: Initialize React + Vite project and build UI with dummy data

## Important Patterns

### Calculation Formulas (Reference)
- **Mortgage**: M = P * [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n-1]
- **Cash Flow**: Rental Income - (Mortgage + Operating Expenses)
- **Cap Rate**: (NOI / Purchase Price) * 100
- **Cash-on-Cash Return**: (Annual Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested) * 100

### Code Preferences
- Use functional components with hooks (no class components)
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Add comments explaining complex calculations
- Use meaningful variable names
- Format currency consistently ($1,234.56)

### Common Commands
- `npm create vite@latest` - Create new Vite project
- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `git add .` - Stage changes
- `git commit -m "message"` - Commit changes
- `git push` - Push to GitHub

## Design Guidelines
- **Colors**:
  - Primary: Blue (#3B82F6)
  - Success: Green (#10B981) - Positive cash flow
  - Warning: Yellow (#F59E0B) - Break-even
  - Danger: Red (#EF4444) - Negative cash flow
- **Layout**: Responsive (mobile-first approach)
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy, readable font sizes
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace, consistent padding

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] App runs without console errors
- [ ] All inputs accept valid values
- [ ] Results display correctly
- [ ] Responsive on mobile, tablet, desktop
- [ ] Calculations are accurate
- [ ] Currency formatting is consistent

## Known Patterns to Avoid
- Don't over-engineer - keep solutions simple
- Don't build features not in the current milestone
- Don't use deprecated React patterns (e.g., class components)
- Don't forget to handle edge cases (0 values, negative numbers)

## Communication Preferences
- Explain technical decisions in simple terms
- Share insights about why certain approaches are chosen
- Provide tips for learning as we build
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are unclear
- Be proactive about potential issues
