## Key Assumptions

**Tax Treatment:**
- Buyers already have enough itemized deductions to exceed standard deduction
- Therefore, ALL mortgage interest and property tax are INCREMENTAL benefits
- This is realistic for high-income buyers who can afford $1.9M homes

**Tax Rates (MFJ):**
- Federal: 24% bracket
- California: 9.3% bracket

**Deduction Limits:**
- Federal SALT cap: $10,000
- Federal mortgage debt limit: $750,000
- CA has no mortgage debt limit
- CA allows full property tax deduction

## The 30-Year Math

### Jubilee Upfront Advantage:
- Keeps $370K more invested
- @ 7% for 30 years = **$2.82M**

### Traditional Monthly Advantage:
- Saves $2,673/month after-tax
- @ 7% for 30 years = **$3.21M**

### Winner: Traditional by ~$390K
(Plus you own 100% vs 40%)

## When Each Option Makes Sense

### Choose Renting if:
- You value flexibility and liquidity
- You don't want maintenance responsibility
- Investment returns exceed home appreciation

### Choose Traditional if:
- You can afford the $370K down payment
- You're optimizing for long-term wealth
- You want maximum home equity
- You plan to stay 10+ years

### Choose Jubilee if:
- You can't access $370K in capital
- You need homeownership NOW for personal reasons
- You value liquidity over wealth maximization
- You plan to leave SF within 5-10 years
- The emotional/family benefits outweigh financial costs

---

## Bottom Line

**Jubilee's value is accessibility, not financial optimization.**

For buyers who can afford 20% down, traditional is $390K better over 30 years after accounting for:
- Lower monthly costs ($2,673/mo less)
- Larger tax benefits ($353/mo more)
- 100% ownership vs 40%

But Jubilee opens homeownership to people who couldn't otherwise afford it.
