## Why Tax Benefits Are Nearly Identical Now

**KEY UPDATE:** California conforms to the federal $750K mortgage debt limit for loans originated after December 15, 2017.

1. **Both scenarios hit the $750K cap** on BOTH federal and CA taxes
2. **Jubilee loan ($746K)** is just under the limit - all interest deductible
3. **Traditional loan ($1.52M)** is way over the limit - only first $750K deductible
4. **Result:** Tax benefits are essentially identical (Jubilee actually gets $18/mo MORE)

## The Financial Reality

### What Jubilee Offers:
- ✅ Much lower down payment ($27K vs $380K)
- ✅ Keep $370K more invested upfront
- ✅ Lower monthly savings requirement to buy
- ✅ Access to homeownership with less capital
- ✅ Nearly identical tax benefits to traditional
- ✅ **~$50K better outcome over 30 years**

### What Jubilee Costs:
- ❌ $6,650/month land lease (7% of $1.14M land value)
- ❌ $2,303/month higher after-tax cost vs traditional
- ❌ Only own 40% of property
- ❌ Only get 40% of appreciation
- ❌ Need to be comfortable with ground lease model

### The Math Over 30 Years:

**Jubilee's upfront advantage:**
- $370K invested @ 7% for 30 years = $2.82M

**Traditional's monthly advantage:**
- $2,303/month savings @ 7% for 30 years = $2.77M

**Winner: Jubilee by ~$50K** (but you only own 40% vs 100%)

## When Jubilee Makes Sense

Jubilee is better if:
1. **You can't access $370K in capital** (even with stock liquidation)
2. **You need homeownership NOW** for personal reasons
3. **You value liquidity** over ownership percentage
4. **You plan to leave SF** within 5-10 years (minimize commitment)
5. **You're comfortable with ground lease** model
6. **You want to optimize pure financial returns** - it's now ~$50K better over 30 years

Jubilee is worse if:
1. **You want 100% ownership** and full appreciation
2. **You're uncomfortable with ground lease** structure
3. **You have the $370K available** and prefer building full equity
4. **You want maximum home equity** and appreciation
5. **You're skeptical of Jubilee's long-term viability** as a company

## Bottom Line

**Jubilee is now a compelling option even for buyers who can afford a traditional 20% down payment.**

Over 30 years:
- Jubilee is ~$50K better financially (due to $370K kept invested)
- Traditional owns 100% of home (vs 40%)
- Traditional builds full equity and gets full appreciation
- Tax benefits are essentially identical

**The decision comes down to:**
- **Ownership vs Liquidity:** Do you prefer 100% ownership or keeping more capital invested?
- **Risk tolerance:** Are you comfortable with the ground lease model?
- **Time horizon:** Planning to stay long-term or move in 5-10 years?

**Jubilee's value proposition has significantly strengthened with the corrected CA tax analysis. It's now nearly financially equivalent (actually slightly better) for high-income earners, while still offering the accessibility advantage for those with less capital.**
