## The Financial Reality

### What Jubilee Offers:
- ✅ Much lower down payment ($27K vs $380K)
- ✅ Keep $370K more invested upfront
- ✅ Lower monthly savings requirement to buy
- ✅ Access to homeownership with less capital

### What Jubilee Costs:
- ❌ $6,650/month land lease (7% of $1.14M land value)
- ❌ $2,673/month higher after-tax cost vs traditional
- ❌ Only own 40% of property
- ❌ Only get 40% of appreciation
- ❌ Smaller tax benefits

### The Math Over 30 Years:

**Jubilee's upfront advantage:**
- $370K invested @ 7% for 30 years = $2.82M

**Traditional's monthly advantage:**
- $2,673/month savings @ 7% for 30 years = $3.21M

**Winner: Traditional by ~$390K** (plus you own 100% vs 40%)

## When Jubilee Makes Sense

Jubilee is better if:
1. **You can't access $370K in capital** (even with stock liquidation)
2. **You need homeownership NOW** for personal reasons
3. **You value liquidity** over long-term wealth maximization
4. **You plan to leave SF** within 5-10 years (minimize commitment)
5. **You expect extraordinary returns** on your invested capital (>15% consistently)

Jubilee is worse if:
1. **You can afford 20% down** (have the $370K available)
2. **You're purely optimizing wealth** over 30 years
3. **You want maximum home equity** and appreciation
4. **You plan to stay long-term** (30+ years)

## Bottom Line

**Jubilee is a valuable option for accessing homeownership with limited capital, but it's not the financially optimal choice for buyers who can afford a traditional 20% down payment.**

Over 30 years:
- Traditional is ~$390K better financially
- Traditional owns 100% of home (vs 40%)
- Traditional gets larger tax benefits
- Traditional has lower monthly cost

**Jubilee's value is in accessibility, not financial optimization.**
