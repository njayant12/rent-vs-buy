## PMI Calculation (FHA for Jubilee)

### Upfront PMI (financed)
- Base loan: $733,400
- Upfront PMI: $733,400 × **1.75%** = **$12,835**
- **Added to loan balance** (financed over 30 years)
- Total loan becomes: $746,234

### Annual PMI (monthly payment)
- Base loan: $733,400 (NOT including upfront PMI)
- Annual PMI: $733,400 × **0.55%** = $4,034/year
- Monthly PMI: **$336/month**
- This continues for life of loan (FHA loans after 2013)

**Total PMI cost in Year 1:**
- Upfront: $12,835 (financed)
- Monthly: $336/month × 12 = $4,034/year
- **Total: $16,869 in PMI costs in year 1**

## Updated 30-Year Math (with 32% tax rate)

### Jubilee Upfront Advantage:

- @ 7% for 30 years = **$2.82M**

### Traditional Monthly Advantage:
- Saves $2,670/month after-tax
- @ 7% for 30 years = **$3.21M**

### Winner: Traditional by ~$390K
(Plus you own 100% vs 40%)

## Key Insights

1. **Federal benefits are nearly identical** because both hit the $750K mortgage debt cap
   - Jubilee: $746K loan (all deductible)
   - Traditional: $1.52M loan (only $750K deductible)

2. **California drives the tax benefit difference** ($363/mo)
   - No mortgage debt limit on CA state taxes
   - Traditional deducts $93K interest, Jubilee deducts $47K

3. **Higher tax rate (32% vs 24%) helps ownership more**
   - Reduces after-tax cost for both ownership scenarios
   - But doesn't change the fundamental trade-off

4. **Jubilee still costs $2,670/mo more after-tax**
   - The $6,650 land lease is still the dominant factor
   - Even with full tax benefits, it's expensive monthly

**Jubilee's value remains accessibility, not optimization.**
