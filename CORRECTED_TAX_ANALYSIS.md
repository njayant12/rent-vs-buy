## Tax Benefits Breakdown

### Federal Benefits (NEARLY IDENTICAL!)

Federal mortgage interest deduction is capped at $750K of debt:

| | Jubilee | Traditional |
|---|---:|---:|
| **Mortgage amount** | $746,234 | $1,520,000 |
| **Federal deductible interest** | $46,640 | $46,125 (first $750K only) |
| **Property tax (capped)** | $10,000 | $10,000 |
| **Total federal deductions** | $56,640 | $56,125 |
| **Federal tax savings @ 32%** | **$1,510/mo** | **$1,497/mo** |

**Federal benefit difference: Only $13/month!**

### California Benefits (NOW ALSO NEARLY IDENTICAL!)

**KEY UPDATE:** California conforms to the federal $750K mortgage debt limit for loans originated after December 15, 2017:

| | Jubilee | Traditional |
|---|---:|---:|
| **Mortgage interest (deductible)** | $46,640 | $46,125 (first $750K only) |
| **Property tax** | $22,420 | $22,420 |
| **Total CA deductions** | $69,060 | $68,545 |
| **CA tax savings @ 9.3%** | **$535/mo** | **$531/mo** |

**CA benefit difference: Only $4/month more for Jubilee!**

### Total Tax Benefits

| Scenario | Federal | California | **Total** |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **Jubilee** | $1,510/mo | $535/mo | **$2,046/mo** |
| **Traditional** | $1,497/mo | $531/mo | **$2,028/mo** |
| **Difference** | -$13/mo | -$4/mo | **-$18/mo** |

**Tax benefits are now essentially identical! Jubilee actually gets $18/month MORE in tax benefits because its $746K loan is just under the limit, while traditional only gets deductions on the first $750K of its $1.52M loan.**

## PMI Calculation (FHA for Jubilee)

### Upfront PMI (financed)
- Base loan: $733,400
- Upfront PMI: $733,400 × **1.75%** = **$12,835**
- **Added to loan balance** (financed over 30 years)
- Total loan becomes: $746,234

### Annual PMI (monthly payment)
- Base loan: $733,400 (NOT including upfront PMI)
- Annual PMI: $733,400 × **0.55%** = $4,034/year
- Monthly PMI: **$336/month**
- This continues for life of loan (FHA loans after 2013)

**Total PMI cost in Year 1:**
- Upfront: $12,835 (financed)
- Monthly: $336/month × 12 = $4,034/year
- **Total: $16,869 in PMI costs in year 1**

## Updated 30-Year Math (with 32% tax rate and corrected CA limit)

### Jubilee Upfront Advantage:
- Keeps $370K more invested
- @ 7% for 30 years = **$2.82M**

### Traditional Monthly Advantage:
- Saves $2,303/month after-tax
- @ 7% for 30 years = **$2.77M**

### Winner: Nearly a TIE! (~$50K difference)
(Plus you own 100% vs 40%)

## Key Insights

1. **Tax benefits are now essentially identical** because BOTH hit the $750K mortgage debt cap on federal AND California taxes
   - Jubilee: $746K loan (all deductible)
   - Traditional: $1.52M loan (only $750K deductible)
   - Jubilee actually gets $18/mo MORE in tax benefits

2. **California now conforms to federal $750K limit** for post-2017 loans
   - Previous analysis assumed CA maintained $1M limit
   - This eliminates the tax benefit advantage traditional had

3. **Higher tax rate (32% vs 24%) helps ownership more**
   - Reduces after-tax cost for both ownership scenarios
   - But doesn't change the fundamental trade-off

4. **Jubilee still costs $2,303/mo more after-tax**
   - The $6,650 land lease is still the dominant factor
   - Tax benefits no longer provide an advantage to traditional
   - The 30-year outcome is now essentially a tie (~$50K difference)

## Bottom Line for $400K W-2 Earners

At this income level with 32% federal rate and CA's $750K conformity:
- Traditional saves **$2,303/month** vs Jubilee after-tax
- That's **$27,634/year** or **$2.77M over 30 years** if invested
- But Jubilee keeps **$370K more invested** = **$2.82M over 30 years**

**The financial outcome is now essentially a TIE (~$50K advantage to Jubilee)**

However, Traditional also:
- Owns 100% of home vs 40%
- Builds full equity
- Gets full appreciation

**Jubilee's value proposition has strengthened: it's now nearly financially equivalent for high-income earners, while still offering the accessibility advantage.**

The choice now depends on:
- **Capital availability** - Do you have $370K for down payment?
- **Ownership preference** - Do you want 100% ownership vs 40%?
- **Liquidity preference** - Keep more invested now vs build equity?
