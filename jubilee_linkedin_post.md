# LinkedIn Post: Jubilee Homes Analysis

## Option 1: Direct and Data-Driven

I just analyzed Jubilee Homes' ground lease model for a $1.9M SF home. The capital efficiency is remarkable.

**The setup:** Everyone saves $7,426/month for 4 years in stocks, grows it for 1 year. At Year 5, you have $439K.

**Three paths:**

**Traditional 20% down:**
- Sell 97.9% of your portfolio
- Pay $19,571 in capital gains tax
- Keep $9K invested

**Jubilee (ground lease):**
- Sell 13.5% of your portfolio
- Pay $2,702 in capital gains tax
- Keep $379K invested

**Renting:**
- Sell 0%
- Pay $0 in tax
- Keep $439K invested

Jubilee lets you become a homeowner while keeping **41x more capital invested** than the traditional path.

The tradeoff? You only own 40% of the property (Jubilee owns the land). You pay a monthly land lease and only get 40% of appreciation.

Is keeping $370K working for you worth owning 40% instead of 100%? That's the $370K question.

## Option 2: More Conversational

My family friends who own a $4M house in the Bay Area can't believe I'm still renting.

I just ran the numbers on Jubilee Homes - a ground lease model where you own the house, they own the land.

For a $1.9M SF home, here's what happens if you saved $7,426/month for 5 years in stocks:

**Traditional 20% down:** You liquidate 98% of your portfolio. You have $9K left invested and $380K locked in your home.

**Jubilee:** You liquidate 13.5%. You have $379K still invested and $27K in home equity.

**Renting:** You liquidate nothing. You have $439K invested and zero equity.

Jubilee keeps you 41x more liquid than buying traditionally.

But you only own 40% of the property. You pay monthly land lease. You only get 40% of appreciation.

The question: Is access to homeownership worth the reduced ownership stake when you can keep $370K compounding at 7%?

I don't know yet. But it's a fascinating alternative to the "you need $410K cash" barrier.

## Option 3: Question-Driven

How do you buy a $1.9M SF home without liquidating your entire portfolio?

I just analyzed Jubilee Homes' ground lease model. Here's the math:

**If you save $7,426/month for 5 years in stocks, you'll have $439K.**

**Path 1 - Traditional 20% down:**
• Liquidate: 98% of portfolio
• Cap gains tax: $19,571
• Still invested: $9,129
• Home equity: $380,000

**Path 2 - Jubilee ground lease:**
• Liquidate: 13.5% of portfolio
• Cap gains tax: $2,702
• Still invested: $379,398
• Home equity: $26,600

**Path 3 - Keep renting:**
• Liquidate: 0%
• Cap gains tax: $0
• Still invested: $438,700
• Home equity: $0

With Jubilee, you keep **41x more capital invested** than buying traditionally.

The catch? You only own the house (40%), not the land (60%). You share appreciation proportionally.

For people who want homeownership but don't want to kill their liquid net worth, this is interesting.

## Option 4: Copy-Paste Ready (Shortest)

I analyzed Jubilee Homes for a $1.9M SF home.

**Traditional 20% down:** Liquidate 98% of your stocks. Keep $9K invested.

**Jubilee ground lease:** Liquidate 13.5%. Keep $379K invested.

That's 41x more capital working for you.

The tradeoff: You only own 40% of the property and get 40% of appreciation.

Is keeping $370K compounding worth owning 40% instead of 100%?

For people priced out of homeownership by the down payment barrier, this is worth exploring.

**Recommended:** Option 3 (Question-Driven) - it's engaging, clear, and tells the full story without being too long.
