# LinkedIn Post: Rent vs. Buy Analysis

---

**I just ran the numbers on rent vs. buy in San Francisco. The results surprised me.**

Most people think buying always beats renting. The math tells a different story.

I analyzed a $1.9M home in SF ($5,800/mo rent) with 4 scenarios:
â€¢ Renting (investing all $1.93M at 7%)
â€¢ 3% down payment
â€¢ 20% down payment
â€¢ 100% cash purchase

**The shocking results:**

ðŸ“Š **With 3% appreciation (national average):**
Renting wins â†’ +$65,500 Year 1 net
20% down â†’ +$31,400
3% down â†’ +$15,630
100% cash â†’ +$1,200 (worst!)

ðŸ“Š **With 7% appreciation (Bay Area boom years):**
20% down wins â†’ +$107,400
3% down â†’ +$91,630
100% cash â†’ +$77,200
Renting â†’ +$65,500

**Why is this counterintuitive?**

1. **Opportunity cost is HUGE** - Money not in the house earns 7% in the market
2. **Tax benefits matter** - $22k/year in deductions for mortgage interest + property tax
3. **Leverage works both ways** - With low appreciation, the costs outweigh the gains
4. **100% cash is the worst** - You lose all investment returns

**The 30-year difference:**
â€¢ 3% appreciation â†’ House worth $4.6M
â€¢ 7% appreciation â†’ House worth $14.5M

That's a $10M difference based on one assumption.

**My takeaway:**
Don't buy just because "everyone says to." Run YOUR numbers with YOUR assumptions. The right answer depends on:
âœ“ How much appreciation you expect
âœ“ Your opportunity cost of capital
âœ“ Your tax situation
âœ“ How long you plan to stay

In hot markets with high appreciation, buying with 20% down wins. In slower markets, renting + investing might be smarter.

What surprised you most about these numbers?

## Alternative Shorter Version

**Rent vs. Buy in San Francisco: I ran the numbers.**

$1.9M home. $5.8k/mo rent. 4 scenarios analyzed.

**3% appreciation:** Renting wins (+$66k vs +$31k buying)
**7% appreciation:** 20% down wins (+$107k vs +$66k renting)

The difference? Opportunity cost. Money not in the house earns 7% in the market.

**Key insight:** Don't buy because "everyone says to." The right answer depends on expected appreciation, opportunity cost, and tax situation.

In hot markets, buying wins. In slower markets, rent + invest is often smarter.
