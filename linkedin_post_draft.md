# LinkedIn Post: Down Payment Strategy

## SHORT VERSION (Quick post)

I just ran the numbers on saving for a $410K down payment in the Bay Area.

**The surprising result:** "Saving safely" in a HYSA is the worst strategy.

Monthly stocks (4 years): Pay $20K in capital gains tax
HYSA (5 years): Lose $44K in opportunity cost

Choosing HYSA to save $1,084/month costs you $195K over 30 years.

That's paying $3.75 for every $1 you "saved."

The counterintuitive truth: Paying tax on gains is better than avoiding gains.

You can't recover lost time.

## MEDIUM VERSION (With more detail)

I spent the weekend analyzing down payment strategies for a $410K Bay Area down payment.

The most surprising finding? Being "conservative" is the most expensive option.

**The comparison:**
• Monthly stocks (4 years): Save $7,426/month, pay $20K capital gains tax
• HYSA (5 years): Save $6,342/month, lose $44K in opportunity cost

**The trade-off:**
HYSA saves you $1,084/month in contributions. But costs you $195K more over 30 years.

That's paying $3.75 for every $1 you "saved."

**Why?**
• Capital gains tax: You earned the gains FIRST, then paid tax
• Opportunity cost: You never earned the gains at all

The 4% annual return difference (7% stocks - 3% HYSA) compounds over time into massive drag.

You cannot "save safely" your way to a down payment. The opportunity cost is more expensive than capital gains tax.

## DETAILED VERSION (Full analysis)

I analyzed every down payment strategy for a $1.9M Bay Area home (20% down = $410K).

Here's what I found:

**THE STRATEGIES:**

1. Fresh RSUs: $0 drag (impossible baseline)
2. Monthly stocks 4yr + grow 1yr: $162K drag (pay $20K tax)
3. HYSA 5 years: $358K drag (lose $44K opportunity cost)
4. HYSA 4 years: $548K drag (lose $67K opportunity cost)

**THE KEY COMPARISON:**

Monthly stocks: $7,426/month for 4 years, pay $20K capital gains tax
HYSA: $6,342/month for 5 years, lose $44K in opportunity cost

Choosing HYSA saves you $1,084/month but costs $195K more over 30 years.

**THE COUNTERINTUITIVE TRUTH:**

Opportunity cost creates MORE drag than capital gains tax:
• Tax: You earned gains first, then paid tax (8.1x multiplier on $20K)
• Opportunity cost: You never earned the gains (8.1x multiplier on $44K)

Same multiplier, but opportunity cost starts 2.2x larger.

**WHY IT MATTERS:**

The 4% annual difference (7% - 3%) over 4-5 years compounds into a permanent hole you can never recover.

Paying $20K in capital gains tax is 2.2x better than losing $44K in opportunity cost.

You can't "save safely" your way to a down payment. The opportunity cost is far more expensive than the tax.

The surprising result: Being "conservative" is the most expensive option.

**Monthly stocks (4 years):**

Choosing HYSA saves you $1,084/month but costs you $195K more over 30 years.

That's paying $3.75 for every $1 you "saved."

**Why?**

Capital gains tax: You earned the gains first, then paid tax.
Opportunity cost: You never earned the gains at all.

The 4% return difference (7% - 3%) compounds over 5 years into a permanent $44K hole that grows to $195K of extra drag.

**The counterintuitive truth:** Paying tax on gains is better than avoiding gains.

You can't recover lost time.
