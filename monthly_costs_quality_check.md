## The Jubilee Trade-off Revisited

### Upfront (Year 5):
✓ Jubilee keeps $370K more invested

### Ongoing (Monthly):
✗ Jubilee costs $2,321/month more

### The Question:
Does $370K invested at 7% for 30 years justify paying $2,321/month more?

**Math:**
- $370K @ 7% for 30 years = $2.82M
- $2,321/month @ 7% for 30 years = $2.79M (if invested instead)

**Rough answer:** The $370K upfront advantage (+$2.82M) and the monthly cost disadvantage (-$2.79M) nearly cancel out over 30 years. **The financial benefit is marginal.**
