## Key Insights

1. **With 3% appreciation (national average):**
   - Renting wins by a wide margin (+$65.5k vs +$31.4k for best buying option)
   - Opportunity cost of invested capital is massive
   - Only makes sense to buy if you expect high appreciation

2. **With 7% appreciation (Bay Area boom):**
   - 20% down is the clear winner (+$107.4k)
   - 3% down is surprisingly competitive (+$91.6k) due to leverage
   - Even 100% cash beats renting (+$77.2k vs +$65.5k)

3. **Tax benefits are significant:**
   - ~$22,000/year in tax savings from mortgage interest + property tax deductions
   - Makes a huge difference in affordability

4. **100% cash is never optimal:**
   - Loses massive opportunity cost of market returns
   - Even with 7% appreciation, 20% down beats it by $30k

5. **The appreciation assumption changes everything:**
   - A 4% difference in appreciation (3% vs 7%) completely flips the decision
   - 30-year difference: $10M in home value

## Conclusion

**Don't buy just because "everyone says to."** The right decision depends entirely on:
- Expected property appreciation
- Your opportunity cost of capital (what else you could do with the money)
- Your tax situation
- How long you plan to stay

In hot markets with high appreciation, buying with 20% down wins. In slower markets, renting + investing is often smarter.
